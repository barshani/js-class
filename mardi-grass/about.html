                <p> LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as
                    the Mayor of New
                    Orleans, Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office.
                    Before
                    becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.
                    Cantrell was re-elected to office by a wide margin in November 2021, securing 65% of the vote.
                    Her campaign focused on the city's status in 2020 as a COVID-19 hotspot and her efforts, which at
                    times were unpopular, to stop the disease's spread. She also stressed the need for higher-paying
                    jobs for city workers, better public health outcomes and new technologies for the future of New
                    Orleans.

            <h2>Mardi Gras History</h2>
            <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the
                Mississippi River in
                what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
                celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the
                festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and
                dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An account
                from
                1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the
                streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed
                whenever
                such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.

                In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent raised money
                to
                fund an official Mardi Gras celebration.

                James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces describes New Orleans
                Mardi
                Gras in 1835:

                Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun,
                frolic,
                and comic masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men
                and
                boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and
                appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen
                with
                heads of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads
                and
                bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the moon; mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade
                and
                march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches, cars, &c., in rich confusion, up and down the
                streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour
                broadcast
                as they wend their reckless way.

                In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to
                observe
                Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mystick Krewe of
                Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New
                Orleans
                had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade
                that
                the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent,
                Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To a certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the
                Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how their business prowess helped them
                construct a
                more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival passed from Creole to
                American
                just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century. The spectacle of
                Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms
                and
                on the streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely
                American."

                In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and weather
                conditions sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American
                Civil
                War, World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.

                The 1898 Rex parade, with the theme of "Harvest Queens," was filmed by the American Mutoscope Co. The
                rumored but long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The two-minute film records 6 parade floats,
                including one transporting a live ox.

                In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved to
                surrounding communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual
                came
                to the city. Masking, costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops
                maintaining
                order. Guardsmen prevented crimes against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws
                regulating
                morality or drug use; for these reasons, some in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as
                the
                city's best Mardi Gras ever.

                In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including
                Mardi
                Gras Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender
                or
                sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the law was
                passed,
                the city demanded that these krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing
                traditions of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the city
                claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to demand otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century
                krewes
                Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus did parade in the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its
                parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000.

                Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two
                federal
                courts later declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights
                of
                free association, and an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance.
                The
                US Supreme Court refused to hear the city's appeal from this decision.

                Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays
                dues,
                and any member can have a place on a parade float.</p>
